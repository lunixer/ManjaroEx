## Notes

Since there is no automatic installation, it must be done by hand. I'm sorry for that but it will come later.

### Requirements:

- Arch Linux "community" package [lsb-release](https://www.archlinux.de/?page=PackageDetails;repo=community;arch=x86_64;pkgname=lsb-release)

> sudo pacman -Syu && sudo pacman -S lsb-release

## Setup

`ManjaroEx` requires an environment running `Manjaro`. Version `17 - Gnome` is recommended, though. For a full guide to setup and use this script, go to the wiki [HowTo ManjaroEx?][].
